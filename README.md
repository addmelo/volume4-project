GDP growth model

Michael Stafford, Tyler Sanders, Andrew Cherpeski, Alex Melo, and Samuel McIntyre

We want to model the GDP growth of a country using the Solow Growth model, which is an ordinary differential equation, described below. In addition, we want to model several different forms of population dynamics and compose that with country growth to see how different trends in population affect the growth of a country. 

$$y(t) = A(t)k(t)^\alpha$$
$$c(t) + i(t) = y(t)$$
$$sy(t) = i(t)$$
$$\dot k(t) = sy(t) - (\delta + n) k(t)$$

Population can be modeled with an SIR model with different age groups, with the assumptions about a constant population relaxed. In addition, there are many models of population interactions involving different age groups in economics that could be considered to combine it with the Solow Growth Model.  

Examples of things we could model with the Solow Growth Model: Recessions, long run effects of policy changes that promote growth, population dynamics (ex. effects of an aging population, effects of a baby boom, etc), technological innovation, changes in savings rate, etc. 

In particular, we want to look at how various possible models for population growth affect things like long run income growth, spending on social security, etc, and the possible effects of policy decisions affecting population dynamics would affect each of these outcomes

It would also be easy to check that our model results conform to reality - there exists mountains of good data on population, GDP, even capital levels and savings rates, so we could see how our model performs if we feed it real life data and plot our predictions against actual data. 

Samuel will take the lead on helping the rest of the group understand the GDP growth models and we will distribute the tasks of testing different population models, modeling population interactions, writing the paper, and generating appropriate figures evenly among group members. Alex will take the lead on the different population models that will be used for the GDP growth models testing. Michael will take the lead on the variation exploring a change in retirement ageâ€™s effect on GDP growth. Andrew's main responsibility will be examining how education, innovation, technology, and external shocks affect economic growth. Tyler will investigate baby booms & busts (population shocks) and their effects on GDP growth.
